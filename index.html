  <h2>Research question</h2>
  How can the application of computer & 3D graphics, motion and extended realities be used by graphic designers to create immersive experiences through sensorially holistic brand systems?
  <br><br><h2>Sub-questions</h2>
  How can the design of brand identities be more sensorially holistic?
  What new properties of the brand can be brought to life by engaging more senses than just the visual?
  How do these technologies change our vocabulary in terms of what we understand as interaction and “visual” language?
  How will these tools in turn change the role and skill-set of the graphic designer?

  <h2>Abstract</h2>

I want to explore new possibilities offered by interactive and multi-sensorially engaging computer-generated techniques on the design of immersive and extended-reality experiences for the purpose of branding.
I will investigate the impact of CG-based technologies✳ on the aforementioned in two ways:
<br><br>A.) as a tool the designer uses to aid them in the design process or build the experience itself and
<br>B.) as a medium the user interacts with that has an impact on the way they experience the content.
<br><br>As we continue to update our tools and our abilities, we should also change the way we approach the design process and we should redefine our role both as the designer and the viewer.

<br><br>A virtual experience does not need to imitate reality. It will never be the same and should not aim or pretend to be. In virtual experiences we miss certain elements that we do find in real physical ones (ex: smells, textures, background sounds, chance encounters) but there’s also many new possibilities that open up to us through these tools in terms of communication and creation.
<br><br>I think the design of experiences is the past and the future of design. The role of the designer and what is demanded of them is in constant flux as media evolves and gives the designer new possibilities and tools to consider and build with. The designer is now an architect, an illusionist, a sculptor, a photographer, a cinematographer, an animator and simply a catalyst all in one, to name a few. The user experience has always been a central point to design but the role the user must play in the interaction is constantly changing, as determined by the media they interact with and their constantly-updating frame of reference.
<br><br>I would like to investigate how advances in computer graphics tools, particularly in the realms of 3D, motion, and extended reality, will influence design as they grow into themselves  and how as designers we can adapt to best take advantage of them and the possibilities they offer in real design application, not just as superficial gimmicks or decoration.
<br><br>The reference should no longer be printed matter, the digital and interactive should not be an afterthought: many of us are digital natives by now and have a different frame of reference when we engage technology. When creating a design system for digital media, we no longer need to refer to the physical world - we are free to visualise and communicate the most abstract of information. To what extent can we push this new visual language? Which new terms can we add to our vocabulary/frame of reference? In what dosage can we implement them, mixed with visual language that is already familiar?
