          <h1>Research question</h1>
          How can the application of computer & 3D graphics, motion and extended realities be used by graphic designers to create immersive experiences through sensorially holistic brand systems?
          <br><br>
          <h2>Sub-questions</h2>
          How can the design of brand identities be more sensorially holistic?
          What new properties of the brand can be brought to life by engaging more senses than just the visual?
          How do these technologies change our vocabulary in terms of what we understand as interaction and “visual” language?
          How will these tools in turn change the role and skill-set of the graphic designer?

          <h1>Abstract</h1>

          I want to explore new possibilities offered by interactive and multi-sensorially engaging computer-generated techniques on the design of immersive and extended-reality experiences for the purpose of branding.
          I will investigate the impact of CG-based technologies✳ on the aforementioned in two ways:
          <br><br>A.) as a tool the designer uses to aid them in the design process or build the experience itself and
          <br>B.) as a medium the user interacts with that has an impact on the way they experience the content.
          <br><br>As we continue to update our tools and our abilities, we should also change the way we approach the design process and we should redefine our role both as the designer and the viewer.

          <br><br>A virtual experience does not need to imitate reality. It will never be the same and should not aim or pretend to be. In virtual experiences we miss certain elements that we do find in real physical ones (ex: smells, textures,
          background sounds, chance encounters) but there’s also many new possibilities that open up to us through these tools in terms of communication and creation.
          <br><br>I think the design of experiences is the past and the future of design. The role of the designer and what is demanded of them is in constant flux as media evolves and gives the designer new possibilities and tools to consider and
          build with. The designer is now an architect, an illusionist, a sculptor, a photographer, a cinematographer, an animator and simply a catalyst all in one, to name a few. The user experience has always been a central point to design but the
          role the user must play in the interaction is constantly changing, as determined by the media they interact with and their constantly-updating frame of reference.
          <br><br>I would like to investigate how advances in computer graphics tools, particularly in the realms of 3D, motion, and extended reality, will influence design as they grow into themselves and how as designers we can adapt to best take
          advantage of them and the possibilities they offer in real design application, not just as superficial gimmicks or decoration.
          <br><br>The reference should no longer be printed matter, the digital and interactive should not be an afterthought: many of us are digital natives by now and have a different frame of reference when we engage technology. When creating a
          design system for digital media, we no longer need to refer to the physical world - we are free to visualise and communicate the most abstract of information. To what extent can we push this new visual language? Which new terms can we add
          to our vocabulary/frame of reference? In what dosage can we implement them, mixed with visual language that is already familiar?

          <h1>Foundations</h1><br>
          <h2>History, enlightenment and the origin of the hierarchy of the senses</h2>

          <br><br>Visual communication, and therefore graphic design, has been around since the earliest days of humankind (think 64,000 year old cave paintings). But it becomes particularly important from the moment when largely nomadic tribes that
          made up hunter-gatherer societies turned into agricultural societies that settled down and most importantly started employing writing. Oral traditions were being recorded and passed down, symbols and eventually alphabets became the building
          blocks of systems and complex civilizations.
          <br><br>The importance of graphic design and the visual arts in general throughout the history of western cultures is partly proof of the existing hierarchy of the senses, in which sight is the most highly regarded. In western cultures,
          sight is closely linked to reason and was raised to its current standing in this hierarchy during the European movement of Enlightenment in the 17-18th centuries. This intellectual movement was a catalyst for new developments in the areas
          of art, politics and philosophy. One of the central ideas of Enlightenment was the use and celebration of reason, the power by which humans understand the universe and improve their own condition. The goals of rational humanity were
          considered to be knowledge, freedom, and happiness.
          <br><br>Another idea central to this movement, related to knowledge and how one can acquire it, is the theory of Empiricism which states that all knowledge comes from sensory experience. Encyclopedia Britannica defines it as the view that
          all concepts originate in experience, that all concepts are about or applicable to things that can be experienced, or that all rationally acceptable beliefs or propositions are justifiable or knowable only through experience. This broad
          definition accords with the derivation of the term empiricism from the ancient Greek word ‘empeiria’, meaning ‘experience.’ Sight is still largely valued as the sense to unlock the truth through reason, which is still today the English
          language contains commonly used expressions such as I’ll believe it when I see it, implying that we will only know if something is true when we witness it with our own eyes. Out of sight, out of mind, meaning that something that is not seen
          is not thought about, is another saying that illustrates the importance placed on the link between sight and our awareness that something exists.<sup>5</sup>
          <br><br>
          <div class="footnote">
            <div class="footnote_spot">⬤ </div><sup>5 </sup>“The use of 'in mind' for 'remembered' and 'out of mind' for 'forgotten' date back to at least the 13th century. The earliest printed citation of a link with memory and the sight of
            something is in John Heywood's A dialogue conteinyng the nomber in effect of all the prouerbes in the Englishe tongue, 1546:
            <br><br><i>Out of sight out of minde.</i><br><br>
            The phrase is used as an example of the supposed comic results that early computer translation and speech recognition programmes came up with. The phrase 'out of sight, out of mind' was supposed to have been translated by a computer as
            'invisible idiot', 'blind and insane' etc. This is on a par with 'computers can wreck a nice peach' (computers can recognise speech), which is also used as an example of how computers lack the general knowledge to compare with humans at
            speech recognition.
            These reports lack consistency and are too neat to be anything other than inventions. There's no evidence to support the stories but they do illustrate that although 'anyone can make a mistake, but to really foul things up you need a
            computer'. Even using more recent (2007) programs to translate 'out of sight, out of mind' into Russian and then back to English the best they could do was 'from the sighting, from the reason'.”
          </div>
          <br><br>
          Closely under it on the hierarchy is hearing, both of these are considered “higher” senses that enjoy a higher social status.. Smell, taste and touch are considered “lower” senses and have even negative connotations (Classen, 2020). They
          become associated with certain cultural values and economic standing; the higher class are too intellectual and consider themselves to be above the “base instincts”, primal pains and pleasures that they link to smell, taste and
          particularly, to touch. I largely see this hierarchy as part of Europe’s effort to appear superior over other peoples and civilisations in order to hold power over them, as it is key to the Eurocentric worldview that first justified and
          then in turn was strengthened by colonialism.
          <br><br>This ideology extends from class and race onto gender as well, as David Howes writes in his paper The Craft of the Senses:
          <br><br>
          <h3>Sensory ideologies of gender have paralleled those of race in the West (Classen, 1997). As a general rule, men have tended to be associated with the “higher,” “spiritual” senses of hearing and especially sight while women were
            associated with the “lower,” “animal” senses of smell, taste and touch. This gender division of the senses was linked to a gender division of social spheres. As Constance Classen’s work has shown, the supposed masculine mastery of sight
            and hearing was deemed to fit men for such activities as travelling, studying and ruling (overseeing), while the female association with the proximity senses made women the guardians of the home, mistresses of the kitchen, the bedroom,
            and the nursery.</h3>
          <br><br>
          To cross these lines drawn by gender divisions seemingly based on biology and the nature of each gender was considered unnatural and at best required the woman to constantly justify herself, and in the worst case scenario could be a reason
          to institutionalise her. Howes goes on to highlight:
          <br><br>
          The social force of the distinction between the sensory-social spheres of men and women is reflected in the fact that there are many Old Masters in the history of Western art (Titian, Rembrandt, etc.) but next to no Old Mistresses.
          <br><br>
          The result is a systematic erasure of women from history in many areas of humanities, arts and sciences. We are in the process of curbing this trend but it’s slow progress when put into historical perspective. According to Eurostat, the
          percentage of women (±8%) who enrolled in tertiary education in the Arts and Humanities more than doubled that of men(±4%). In the UK, 63% of all students in creative arts and design courses are female but 78% of the UK’s design workforce
          is male. This isn’t an isolated case, it’s a recurring issue in many countries and simply has to be addressed. Similarly to the way we have to work towards giving women and non-binary people the same standing as men, we need to reconsider
          the hierarchy of the senses and deconstruct it.
